# Get Your API Key

You can use Blockchain APIs without an API key. But without an API key, you are heavily limited.

In this tutorial, you will learn how you can get an API key for free.

## STEP 1: Create an account

First, you need to create an account at: https://dashboard.blockchainapis.io/

To do so, specify your e-mail address in the form:

<img loading="eager" alt="Blockchain APIs dashboard (Sign UP)" src="/img/docs/api-key/sign-up.png" />

Once you have put your e-mail address, you need to check your e-mail for a subscription link. The link should look like this:

<img loading="eager" alt="Verification email" src="/img/docs/api-key/verification-email.png" />

By clinking with this page, you should end up in the subscription page:

:::danger
Make sure that the url that you have starts with: https://dashboard.blockchainapis.io/
:::

<Tabs groupId="subscription" queryString>
<TabItem value="individual" label="Individual" default>

If you create an account for yourself, you should fill up this form. If you instead
to create an account for your company, follow [this link](?subscription=company)

<img loading="eager" alt="Account creation (Individual)" src="/img/docs/api-key/create-account.png" />


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="company" label="Company">

If you create an account for your company, you need to fill the form below. If you instead want
to create an account as an individual, follow [this link](?subscription=individual)

<img loading="eager" alt="Account creation (Company)" src="/img/docs/api-key/create-account-company.png" />

If your company is part of the European Union, the VAT number of your company will be asked:

<img loading="eager" alt="Account creation (Company VAT)" src="/img/docs/api-key/vat.png" />

:::tip
The option to put the VAT number of your company is only displayed if you select a country that
is part of the European Union
