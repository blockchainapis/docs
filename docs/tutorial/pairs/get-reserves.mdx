Liquidity pools have a certain amount of tokens in reserve to allow other people to trade with
these tokens.

Knowing this reserve can allow you to do these things:
- Compute the price of a certain token depending on another
- Verify if there is enough liqudity to make the pair worth trading
- Simulate the amount of tokens that you will get for a certain exchange

The goal of this tutorial is to teach you how to get the reserves of any pair using Blockchain APIs.

## Step 1: Install the SDK

Get the SDK for your favorite language:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Tabs groupId="programming-language" queryString>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">
            {`pip install blockchain-apis`}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Create the Blockchain APIs instance

<Tabs groupId="programming-language" queryString>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```py showLineNumbers
from blockchainapis import BlockchainAPIsSync

blockchain_apis = BlockchainAPIsSync()
# do some stuff...
```
:::success
This solution works, but for better performance, you can use [Python-Async](?programming-language=async-python#step-2-create-the-instance)
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="async-python" label="Python-Async">

```py showLineNumbers
import asyncio

from blockchainapis import BlockchainAPIs

# We need to create an async function, because we can't do async calls in main Python thread.
async def get_exchanges():
    # We instanciate the Blockchain APIs instance using Python
    # async with feature, this way we are sure that the API instance
    # is closed at the end
    async with BlockchainAPIs() as blockchain_apis:
        # do some stuff...
        pass

asyncio.run(get_exchanges())
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
