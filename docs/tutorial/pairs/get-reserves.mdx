title: "Get Reserves"
description: "Learn how to get the reserves inside of a liquidity pool the fastest way possible"
sidebar_position: 2
---

Liquidity pools have a certain amount of tokens in reserve to allow other people to trade with
these tokens.

Knowing this reserve can allow you to do these things:
- Compute the price of a certain token depending on another
- Verify if there is enough liqudity to make the pair worth trading
- Simulate the amount of tokens that you will get for a certain exchange

The goal of this tutorial is to teach you how to get the reserves of any pair using Blockchain APIs.

## Step 1: Install the SDK

Get the SDK for your favorite language:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Tabs groupId="programming-language" queryString>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">
            {`pip install blockchain-apis`}
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Create the Blockchain APIs instance

<Tabs groupId="programming-language" queryString>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```py showLineNumbers
from blockchainapis import BlockchainAPIsSync

blockchain_apis = BlockchainAPIsSync()
# do some stuff...
```
:::success
This solution works, but for better performance, you can use [Python-Async](?programming-language=async-python#step-2-create-the-instance)
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="async-python" label="Python-Async">

```py showLineNumbers
import asyncio

from blockchainapis import BlockchainAPIs

# We need to create an async function, because we can't do async calls in main Python thread.
async def get_reserves(blockchain: str, token0: str, token1: str):
    # We instanciate the Blockchain APIs instance using Python
    # async with feature, this way we are sure that the API instance
    # is closed at the end
    async with BlockchainAPIs() as blockchain_apis:
        # do some stuff...
        pass

asyncio.run(get_reserves("ethereum", "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2", "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"))
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Get the reserves

<Tabs groupId="programming-language" queryString>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```py showLineNumbers
from blockchainapis import BlockchainAPIsSync

blockchain_apis = BlockchainAPIsSync()

# Get reserves for WETH-USDC pair on blockchain ethereum
# highlight-next-line
reserves = blockchain_apis.reserves(blockchain="ethereum", token0="0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2", token1="0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48")
```

Here we call the <a href="/docs/python-sdk/blockchain-apis-sync/reserves" target="_blank">reserves</a> method of the Blockchain APIs instance.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="async-python" label="Python-Async">

```py showLineNumbers
import asyncio

from blockchainapis import BlockchainAPIs

async def get_reserves(blockchain: str, token0: str, token1: str):
    async with BlockchainAPIs() as blockchain_apis:
        # Do the API call in order to get the reserves
        # highlight-next-line
        reserves = await blockchain_apis.reserves(blockchain=blockchain, token0=token0, token1=token1)

# Get the reserves for WETH-USDC on the ethereum blockchain
asyncio.run(get_reserves("ethereum", "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2", "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"))

### Method parameters

#### blockchain

The id of the blockchain that you want to get the reserves from.

This is a mandatory parameter. In the given example, we have put the id `ethereum`.

:::tip
You can get the list of valid blockchain ids by following this tutorial: [Get Supported Blockchains](/docs/tutorial/blockchains/get-supported-blockchains)
:::

#### token0

The address of one of the two tokens of the pair from which you want to get the liquidity from.

Here we have put the token: `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` which correspond
to the Wrapped Ethereum token.

#### Token1

The address of the other token of the pair from which you want to get the liquidity.

Here we have put the token: `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` which correspond
to the USDC token.

#### Exchange (optional)

The id of the exchange from which you want get the reserves. This parameter is optional.

For example if you wanted to get the reserves of the pair WETH-USDC on UniswapV2:

<Tabs groupId="programming-language" queryString>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```py showLineNumbers
from blockchainapis import BlockchainAPIsSync

blockchain_apis = BlockchainAPIsSync()

# Get reserves for WETH-USDC pair on blockchain ethereum
reserves = blockchain_apis.reserves(blockchain="ethereum",

                                    token1="0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
                                    # highlight-next-line

from blockchainapis import BlockchainAPIs

async def get_reserves(blockchain: str, token0: str, token1: str):

        # token1 in blockchain blockchain and exchange uniswapv2_ethereum
        reserves = await blockchain_apis.reserves(blockchain=blockchain,

### The returned model

<Tabs groupId="programming-language" queryString>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

The <a href="/docs/python-sdk/blockchain-apis-sync/reserves" target="_blank">reserves</a> method returns a List of <a href="/docs/python-sdk/models/Reserve" target="_blank">Reserve</a> model.

Here is the structure of the <a href="/docs/python-sdk/models/Reserve" target="_blank">Reserve</a> model:
```py
@dataclass(slots=True, frozen=True)
class Reserve
    blockchain: str
    exchange: str
    token0: str
    token1: str
    reserve0: int
    reserve1: int
```

#### blockchain

The id of the blockchain that the pair is.

#### exchange

The id of the exchange in which the token has the given reserves

#### token0

The address of the token0. It is the same address as the token0 that
you have put during your `reserves` call.

#### token1

The address of the token1. It is the same address as the token1 that you
have put during your `reserves` call.

#### reserve0

The reserve of `token0` that is inside of the pair for the given exchange id.

#### reserve1

The reserve of `token1` that is inside of the pair for the given exchange id.

:::tip
`reserve0` and `reserve1` are written in their unisgned integer form. This
unsigned integer form is recomended in order to make computations but, if you
are willing to display this number in a more user friendly way, you can follow

### Print the result

In order to print the result, we have built a pretty-print method, that will print
