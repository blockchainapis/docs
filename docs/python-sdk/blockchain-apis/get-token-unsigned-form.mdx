import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

```py
def get_token_unsigned_form(self, amount: str, decimals: int) -> int:
```
method does the reverse of get_token_decimal_form)

This method should be used when you receive an amount from a user, in order to convert his
input.

For the highest precision, the implementation only uses str

## Parameters

 - [amount](#amount): The amount in str format that you want to convert
 - [decimals](#decimals): The amount of decimals that the token has. You can use the [decimals](/docs/python-sdk/blockchain-apis/decimals)
method in order to get the amount of decimals.

## Returns

<CodeBlock language="python">
    <a href="/docs/python-sdk/models/int">int</a>
</CodeBlock>

The amount converted to unsigned integer
## Example

### Usage

```py
import asyncio

from BlockchainAPIs import BlockchainAPIs

async def print_get_token_unsigned_form():
    # Create the BlockchainAPIs instance
    # You can additionaly add an API key if you want
    blockchain_apis = BlockchainAPIs()
    # Convert a token from his decimal form back to his unsigned integer form (this
    get_token_unsigned_form = await blockchain_apis.get_token_unsigned_form(
        amount="2.5"
        decimals=18
    )
    print(get_token_unsigned_form)
    # We need to close our instance once we are done with BlockchainAPIs
    await BlockchainAPIs.close()

asyncio.run(print_get_token_unsigned_form())
```
