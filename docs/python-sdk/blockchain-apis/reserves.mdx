import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

```py
async def reserves(self, blockchain: str, token0: str, token1: str, exchange: str | None=None) -> List[Reserve]:
```
Get the liquidity inside of the reserve of two tokens.

## Parameters

 - [blockchain](#blockchain): The id of the blockchain on which the exchange will happen. It is required because some tokens can have same address accross multiple blockchains
 - [token0](#token0): The address of the first token of the pair
 - [token1](#token1): The address of the second token of the pair
 - [exchange](#exchange): The id of the exchange from which you want to get the reserve, defaults to None

## Returns

<CodeBlock language="python">
    List[<a href="/docs/python-sdk/models/Reserve">Reserve</a>]
</CodeBlock>

The list of all of the reserve for the given pair, blockchain and exchange.
Can return an empty list if the given pair was not found.


## Example

### Usage

```py
import asyncio

from BlockchainAPIs import BlockchainAPIs

async def print_reserves():
    # Create the BlockchainAPIs instance
    # You can additionaly add an API key if you want
    blockchain_apis = BlockchainAPIs()
    # Get the liquidity inside of the reserve of two tokens.
    reserves = await blockchain_apis.reserves(
        blockchain="ethereum"
        token0="0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"
        token1="0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"
        exchange=uniswapv2_ethereum
    )
    print(reserves)
    # We need to close our instance once we are done with BlockchainAPIs
    await BlockchainAPIs.close()

asyncio.run(print_reserves())
```

## Exceptions

- [BlockchainNotSupportedException](/docs/python-sdk/exceptions/blockchain-not-supported-exception): When an invalid blockchain id is given
- [ExchangeNotSupportedException](/docs/python-sdk/exceptions/exchange-not-supported-exception): When an invalid exchange id is given
- [PairNotFoundException](/docs/python-sdk/exceptions/pair-not-found-exception): When a pair is not found for the given blockchain or exchange
