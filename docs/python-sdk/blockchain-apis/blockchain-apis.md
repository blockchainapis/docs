High-frequency DEX API

    
Our API empowers you to access live financial data across multiple blockchains (currently supporting 6, with more on the way) with unparalleled speed and efficiency.

What sets our API apart? We've optimized performance to deliver an impressive 1000+ calls per second per user, with a lightning-fast processing time of less than 2 millisecond per request. Compare that to other solutions with a 20-millisecond processing time and fewer requests per second, and it's clear why developers choose our API for their trading bots.

Another game-changing feature is our seamless integration across various blockchains and protocols. With our API, you can reuse the same code without changing a single line, simplifying the development process and saving you valuable time.
