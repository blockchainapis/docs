### Usage

```py
import asyncio

from BlockchainAPIs import BlockchainAPIs

async def print_amount_out():
    # Create the BlockchainAPIs instance
    # You can additionaly add an API key if you want
    blockchain_apis = BlockchainAPIs()
    # Get the amount of tokenOut that you will get after selling amountIn tokenIn
    amount_out = await blockchain_apis.amount_out(
        blockchain="ethereum"
        tokenIn="0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"
        tokenOut="0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"
        amountIn=1000000000000000000
        exchange=uniswapv2_ethereum
    )
    print(amount_out)
    # We need to close our instance once we are done with BlockchainAPIs
    await BlockchainAPIs.close()

asyncio.run(print_amount_out())
```
