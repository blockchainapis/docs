from BlockchainAPIs import BlockchainAPIs

async def print_amount_in():
    # Create the BlockchainAPIs instance
    # You can additionaly add an API key if you want
    blockchain_apis = BlockchainAPIs()
    # Get the amount of tokenIn that you need to sell in order to get amountOut tokenOut
    amount_in = await blockchain_apis.amount_in(
        blockchain="ethereum"
        tokenIn="0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"
        tokenOut="0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"

        exchange=uniswapv2_ethereum
    )
    print(amount_in)
    # We need to close our instance once we are done with BlockchainAPIs
    await BlockchainAPIs.close()

asyncio.run(print_amount_in())
```
